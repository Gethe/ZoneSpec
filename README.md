This addon will allow you to save your talent and glyph choices based on the area you are in. The next time you enter the same area, a row of icons will be displayed representing the talents or glyphs currently saved for that location.

When you have six or less of the clearing reagent (Tomes of the Clear Mind, etc.), an icon will appear along with how much you have left.
